## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a web developer from Bangladesh working with a strong focus on laravel mainly using MVC or TALL stack. 
I have been web developing field for 7 years now and for the past 3 years, Iâ€™ve been specializing in Laravel, particularly enjoying how the TALL stack enables me to build dynamic and modern web applications. FilamentPHP is awesome btw.
